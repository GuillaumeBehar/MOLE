The findings suggest that identifying risk factors for postpartum alcohol misuse is an important step in preventing alcohol misuse and improving postpartum health for the birthing parent and infant.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Objective:** To examine the association between prenatal stress exposure and postpartum alcohol misuse among women veterans.\n* **Methods:** Data were drawn from a multisite prospective cohort study of pregnant and postpartum women veterans. The study included interviews, PTSD diagnosis, and postpartum scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C).\n* **Results:** Models showed a statistically significant association of both PTSD and stress exposure with postpartum alcohol misuse.
