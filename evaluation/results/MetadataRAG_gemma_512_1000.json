This is based on the findings of a study published in the journal \"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology.\"\n\nThe study found that xenon preconditioning increased the expression of miR-21 in the kidneys of mice, which led to a decrease in apoptosis and a reduction in inflammation. Additionally, xenon treatment significantly upregulated the expression of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 and decreased the expression of proapoptotic protein phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10. These changes in miR-21 and its target proteins contributed to the protective effect of xenon against septic AKI.\n\nTherefore, the results of this study suggest that xenon may be a promising treatment for septic AKI.
