    'The extract exhibited antidiabetic and antidyslipidemic effect.

Therefore, REKRG is a very useful food for preventing or improving various cardiovascular diseases.', 'The risk of developing radiation induced cancer is significant for young people if exposed to relatively high dose radiation as is the case in WBCT. WBCT in high-energy trauma is important for planning of treatment in severely injured patients while it can be questioned in the seemingly not injured where it is used mainly to permit early discharge from the ED.', 'The present study highlights the interactions of the relationship between FE(NO) and bronchial responsiveness with smoking and atopy, suggesting different mechanisms behind atopy- and smoking-related increases of bronchial responsiveness.', 'Subjects with type 2 diabetes and inadequate control had lower FVC and FEV1 than predicted and than those of subjects with adequate control. It is postulated that poorer pulmonary function may be associated with increased levels of inflammatory mediators.', 'We confirmed Ae. aegypti to be the most likely mosquito vector of ZIKV in Australia, although the restricted distribution of this species will limit the receptive zone to northern Queensland where this species occurs. Importantly, the role in ZIKV transmission of Culex and other Aedes spp. tested will be negligible. Despite being the implicated vector, the relatively high ID50 and need for a high titer disseminated infection in Ae. aegypti suggest that high mosquito population densities will be required to facilitate epidemic ZIKV transmission among the currently immunologically naïve human population in Australia.', 'Dyspnea is a complex perception, and in patients with fILD, O2 may lessen, but does not resolve, it. Further research is needed to clarify why fILD patients who use O2 perceive greater levels of dyspnea with activity than O2 non-users.', 'These results suggest that CTCs in MBC patients are associated with increased risk of VTE. These patients should be followed up more closely for the risk of VTE.', 'Hyperoxia is frequently seen but in most cases does not lead to adjustment of ventilator settings if FiO(2) <0.41.

After the same adjustments, serum uric acid was associated with 31% increased risk of stroke in men.', 'These results suggest that PCDH1 is important for airway function as a physical barrier, and its dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. We also suggest that glucocorticoids promotes epithelial barrier integrity by inducing PCDH1.', 'Modified Meek grafting is a useful method of skin expansion. Similar to any other grafting technique, infection needs to be sought and treated promptly. It is recommended for larger burns where donor sites are not adequate or where it is desirable to limit their extent.', 'PSORI-CM01 inhibits epidermal hyperplasia in imiquimod-induced mouse psoriasis-form model and reduces keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. Our results indicate that PSORI-CM01 may possess therapeutic potential for psoriasis by inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation through downregulation of cyclin B2.', 'An acidic oligopeptide displayed on AAV2 improves axial muscle tropism and decreases liver tropism after systemic delivery. This modification should be useful in creating AAV vectors that are suitable for gene therapy for diseases involving the proximal muscles.', 'Culture and susceptibility results have highlighted that MDR is an emerging problem for young horses in New Zealand (NZ), where a bacterial respiratory infection is suspected.
